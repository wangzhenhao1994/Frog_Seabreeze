PLEASE NOTICE:
The two VI's 2D Scan.vi and Show_Save_Load_ XYZ_Data.vi use the libwxPIGraph3D.so
shared object. Unfortunately the libwxPIGraph3D.so shared object wasn't able to run
on all of the most common Linux distributions at the time of this release. If you want
to use these two vi's, or a vi which makes use of those two vi's, please look for
software updates on our download server or contact us.



INSTALLATION:

First, login as superuser

>> user:> su
>> Password:
>> [root@]#

To update already existing PI GCS LabVIEW drivers type:
>> [root@]# ./INSTALL.E-709_GCS_LabVIEW_digital -u

To install the PI GCS LabVIEW drivers type:
>> [root@]# ./INSTALL.E-709_GCS_LabVIEW_digital

To remove the PI GCS LabVIEW drivers type:
>> [root@]# ./INSTALL.E-709_GCS_LabVIEW_digital -r


To increase our knowledge of different Linux distributions, we are always
glad to receive feedback about how the software runs on your system.
Are there any missing libraries or header files, do all scripts work on
your system, ?...
Please contact us (support-software@pi.ws) and please do not forget
to let us know which distribution you are working with.
