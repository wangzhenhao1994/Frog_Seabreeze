as for example the NanoCapture(TM) Software, PIMikroMove(TM) Software and
further software tools as the PI General Command Set, Labview Driver Set or
Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) for a stand alone use or an integration with
third party software products (hereinafter referred to as "Software")
to the Customer. 
The Software is supplied by PI to the Customer either in machine-readable
form or in machine-readable form together with its source code and is subject
to the following Terms and Conditions.

	provided that the Modified Software is licensed to the third party
	exclusively for use for and in relation with the operation of Hardware
	manufactured by PI and delivered along with the Modified Software and
	that such a third party shall not be granted any rights of use beyond
	the rights of use granted to Customer under these Terms and Conditions.

3.  Liability for Deficiencies in Quality or Title 
  a.	Definitions 
    i.	The Software is defective in quality in the event it does not show
	the contractually stipulated condition or it does not fit the contractually
	stipulated purpose. 
    ii.	The Software is subject to proprietary rights (particularly copyrights)
	of PI and/or third parties. It constitutes a defect in title if required
	rights for the contract-based usage could not be legally granted to the
	Customer. 
  b.	Statute of Limitations 
    i.	The statute of limitations for claims of defects is 12 months, calculated
	from the date of the delivery of the Software. 
    ii.	This does not apply in the event of actions of PI or its representatives
	or vicarious agents (Erfuellungsgehilfen) in bad faith or in relation to
	guarantees granted. 
  c.	Modifications to the Software by the Customer
        As far as the Customer modifies the Software or has it modified by third
	parties, claims regarding defects in quality or title shall be invalidated,
	unless the Customer proofs that the defect was not caused by the
	modifications and also if the analysis and the removal of the defect is
	not affected by the modification. 
  d.	Obligations to Examine and Notify Defects 
    i.	After delivery of the Software to the Customer, the Customer will examine
	the Software for completeness and possible defects and notify PI
	immediately of any complaints. Lacking such a notification of complaints,
	claims of the Customer as defined in the following clauses are invalidated
	in relation to such defects in quality that would have been obvious within
	a properly conducted examination. 
    ii.	The Customer has to provide PI together with the notification of the
	defect with comprehensible documentation thereof. 
  e.	Supplementary Performance (Nacherfuellung) 
    i.	PI may remedy the defect by reworking the Software (Nachbesserung) or
	by supplying a replacement, as it chooses. The Customer may request within a
	reasonable time period a reworking or a supply of a replacement of the
	Software, if another type of supplementary performance is unreasonable. 
    ii.	PI can remedy the defect by providing instructions electronically, by phone,
	in writing or by providing updates for download on its homepage to
	the Customer. 
  f.	Bad Faith (Arglist), Guarantees
        Statutory claims of the Customer remain unaffected in case of actions
	of PI or its representatives or vicarious agents in bad faith or in relation
	to guarantees granted. 
  g.	Measures in the event of alleged defects in title 
    i.	Should a third party raise claims against the Customer based on the
	allegation that the Software or the designation of the Software infringes
	its intellectual property rights, the Customer will notify PI immediately
	thereof and entrust PI with the defence against the alleged claims as far
	as possible. The Customer will provide to PI any reasonable support
	in this regard. 
    ii.	PI can remedy a defect in title by providing the Customer with a
	legally unchallengeable option to use either the Software or a legally
	unchallengeable modification of the Software, at its sole disgression. 
    iii.If not stipulated otherwise the regulations of this clause remain also
	applicable equivalently in relations to defects in title. 

4.  Limitation of Liability PI only assumes liability
	under the following conditions: 
  a.	For damage caused by PI or any of its legal representatives, executive
	staff or vicarious agents through wilful intent or gross negligence,
	PI is liable without restriction. 
  b.	PI is not liable for any violation of insignificant contractual obligations
	by minor negligence. With regard to a violation of essential contractual
	obligations (i.e. obligations which the contractual partner can expect
	to be fulfilled and the fulfilment of which is required for the due
	execution of the contract) PI's liability for damage caused by minor
	negligence is limited to anticipated damage typical to contracts of this
	kind (vertragstypisch vorhersehbare Schaeden). The same applies to violations
	of obligations through minor negligence committed by legal representatives,
	executive staff or vicarious agents of PI. 
  c.	The aforementioned limitation of liability does not apply in the event of
	fraudulent intent, injury to life, body and health, breach of warranty,
	and claims based on the German Product Liability Act (ProduktHaftG). 

5.  Data Backup
        The Customer is responsible to backup his data regularly. In the event
	of a loss of data caused culpably by PI, the liability of PI is limited
	to the costs of reproducing the lost data on the basis of the backups that
	the Customer was under the obligation to conduct and for costs for reproducing
	data that would have been also lost, even if the Customer had
	conducted regular backups. 

6.  Final Provisions 
  a.	The place of performance for deliveries shall be the registered
	Office of PI (Sitz). 
  b.	The District court of Karlsruhe (Landgericht) shall have jurisdiction
	over all disputes arising from these Terms and Conditions. 
  c.	The laws of Germany shall apply. International purchase laws shall not apply.
	This shall, in particular, refer to the UN Convention (CISG) on the
	International Sale of Goods. 
  d.	The invalidity of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not
	affect the validity of the other provisions. Invalid provisions shall be
	deemed to be replaced by such valid provisions that shall be suitable to
	implement the economic purpose of the deleted provision to the greatest
	extent possible. The same applies for omissions.
